# üß† Brain Tumor Detection and Classification with GUI

This project is a comprehensive deep learning application for brain tumor **segmentation** and **classification** using MRI scans. It includes a **ResUNet** model for segmentation, a custom **CNN** for tumor classification, and a **Tkinter GUI** that allows users to interact with the system seamlessly.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation** using ResUNet.
- **Tumor Classification** into four categories:  
  - Glioma Tumor  
  - Meningioma Tumor  
  - Pituitary Tumor  
  - No Tumor
- **Tumor Size Estimation** as a percentage of brain region.
- **Graphical User Interface** for uploading images and visualizing results.
- Built using **Keras**, **OpenCV**, **PIL**, and **Tkinter**.

## üñºÔ∏è GUI Preview

The GUI enables users to:
- Upload an MRI brain scan.
- View:
  - Original Image
  - Binary (Grayscale) Image
  - Segmented Tumor Mask
  - Tumor Area Highlighted
- See the **predicted tumor type** and **tumor size** percentage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Main Libraries Used:

* `tensorflow` / `keras`
* `opencv-python`
* `numpy`
* `Pillow`
* `matplotlib`
* `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

---

## üß™ Running the Application

1. Ensure that the trained models are available:

   * `ResUnet.keras` for segmentation
   * `brain_tumor_cnn.h5` for classification

2. Place the model files in the correct paths as specified in `app.py`.

3. Run the GUI:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Upload a brain MRI image (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) and view the results.

---

## üìí Notebooks

* `CNN.ipynb`: Includes training logic and evaluation for the CNN classifier.
* `resUnet(3).ipynb`: Contains the model architecture and training logic for the ResUNet-based segmentation.

---

## üìå Notes

* The GUI and scripts are configured with **hardcoded paths** for model files and icons. You may need to adjust the paths in `app.py` accordingly.
* Input images must be MRI scans with appropriate preprocessing (grayscale recommended).
* Accuracy and results may vary based on the quality of training data and model tuning.

### ‚úÖ Next Steps:

- Create a `requirements.txt` file for dependencies.
- Add a few example images and model weights if sharing publicly.
- Add screenshots in an `assets/` directory if you want visual previews in your README.

Would you like me to create the `requirements.txt` file or help you refactor the hardcoded model paths in `app.py`?
