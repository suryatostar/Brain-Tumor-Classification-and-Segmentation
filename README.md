# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection and Classification with GUI

This project implements a deep learning pipeline to **segment** and **classify brain tumors** from MRI images. It features a **ResUNet** model for segmentation, a **CNN** for classification, and a fully functional **Tkinter-based GUI** for interactive predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation** using ResUNet
- **Classification** of tumors into:
  - Glioma Tumor
  - Meningioma Tumor
  - Pituitary Tumor
  - No Tumor
- **Tumor Size Estimation**
- **Graphical User Interface** for easy image upload and real-time predictions

## 🖥️ GUI Demo

The application allows users to:

1. Upload a brain MRI image.
2. View:
   - Original Image
   - Grayscale/Binary Image
   - Segmented Tumor Mask
   - Tumor Highlighted Overlay
3. Get predicted tumor type and tumor size in %.

> **Note:** Add screenshots in the `/assets` folder to show examples in your GitHub README.

---

## 🔧 Installation

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Requirements:

* `tensorflow`
* `keras`
* `opencv-python`
* `numpy`
* `Pillow`
* `matplotlib`
* `tkinter` (included with most Python installs)

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Ensure you have the following files:

   * `brain_tumor_cnn.h5` (CNN model)
   * `ResUnet.keras` (Segmentation model)
   * Required icon files in an `icons/` folder

2. Modify the file paths in `app.py` if needed.

3. Run the GUI:

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## 📓 Notebooks

* **CNN.ipynb**: Code for training and testing the CNN classifier.
* **resUnet(3).ipynb**: Code for building and training the ResUNet model.

### 🔧 Additional Suggestions:

1. **File Name**: Save this as `README.md` (not `.txt`).
2. **Assets**: Add a folder named `assets` or `icons` for images used in the GUI.
3. **requirements.txt**: Want me to generate this file based on your code?

Let me know if you'd like:
- A ready-to-use `requirements.txt`
- Refactored `app.py` with relative paths for cross-platform compatibility  
- A `LICENSE` file (MIT, Apache, etc.) for open-source use
